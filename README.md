# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use MapPlotLib and Pandas to analyze and create visualizations on PyBer data to see where improvements could be made. Using Pandas, we created dataframes to show how rides, fares, and number of drivers differed based on whether a city was urban, suburban, or rural. We used MapPlotLib to create a line chart showing the results.

## Results

Here are the differences between each city:

- Urban: Urban cities had the highest number of rides and drivers. While also having the lowest average fare per ride and per driver, urban cities still came out with the highest total fare.

- Suburban: Suburban cities had a little less than half the number of rides compared to urban cities. Suburban cities also had about 1/5 of the total number of drivers compared to urban cities. The average fare per ride was about $6 more than urban fares. In addition, suburban average fare per driver was more than double the average fare per driver for urban cities. Despite the higher average fares, suburban city fares were only about half of the total fares for urban cities.

- Rural: Rural cities came out with the lowest number of rides and drivers. Rural cities also had the highest average fare per ride and per driver. The total fares for rural cities was way less than suburban and urban total fares.
